# Functional Python

Here I am going to document what I can learn about functional programing in python under one single week.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

I do not work here in a NEW virtualbox or Docker environment.
As a home project I just Use my default ubuntu 16.04 what is obviously not that default because I am using conda environment git and som other stuff. 


### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them
